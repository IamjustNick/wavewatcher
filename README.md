# Wavewatcher
Description: Wavewatcher is an application that connects to surf cameras and identifies waves suitable for surfing. It uses a CNN trained algorithm on a manually labeled dataset of 600 images of beaches.

The interface allows you to either check regularly updated assesments or interface with a button to get a real time prediction based on 15 images spaces by a few seconds each. As a result the interaction is quite slow but we did this in order to prevent incorrect predictions based on partially ocluded situations (like a truck passing by in front of the camera).
